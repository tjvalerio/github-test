# This is a test, This is ONLY a test.
# If this were not a test, there wouldn't be this
# nonsensical text here telling you this were only
# a test. Capisce???

# So just for fun, and to justify making some changes to this file
# I just want to define "Capisce", it is Italian-American slang for
# "understand?"

# A change to our downloaded file, followed by a push
# See what happens??

# Another push test on January 28th
# Push test on January 30, 2024

# just checking that I understand this stuff before I make my
# changes to my SDL-hyperion fork, also changed up above
# "Italian-Americant" to "Italian-American"
# the time is now: 6:26 p.m. August 29, 2024

# Go for it!!
